## Oversimplified Aggregate Particle

There are three different ways of calculating the specific gravity of an aggregate (depending on which combination of components one includes in the volume of the aggregate) -

- __Apparent Specific Gravity, G<sub>sa</sub> - __ The volume of the aggregate doesn't include the water-permeable voids

- __Bulk Specific Gravity, G<sub>sb</sub> - __ The volume of the aggregate includes the water-permeable voids

- __Effective Specific Gravity, G<sub>se</sub> - __ The volume of the aggregate doesn't include 'that portion of the water-permeable voids which isn't filled with bitumen'

_Note:_ In the subscripts, 's' - stone, 'a' - apparent, 'b' - bulk, & 'e' - effective
