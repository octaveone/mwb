# ***What's This Blog About?***

I started this blog out of boredom concomitant with online classes & webinars. I really hoped that studying in Hyderabad would allow me to rediscover my inner carnivore. 

Instead, I'm stuck indoors & mostly find myself staring at my laptop screen when I'm awake. So, you'll find posts on -

- What I have been reading - I usually read non-fiction (Economic & Commodity History, on India, etc), & occasionally fiction

- Some tidbits related to my academic interests

- And finally a few ramblings, here & there
