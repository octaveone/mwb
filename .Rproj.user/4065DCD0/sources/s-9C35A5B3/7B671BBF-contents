# Notes of an Insomniac
  
Of the many extraordinary qualities I possess, asking stupid questions is the one which
I'm really proud of. Such a quality is deemed valuable in a slave to an excessively inquiring mind. 

This has lead to the impression, amongst those around me, that I am beyond 
reproach, & should be just left to being myself.

In the spirit of disorganized inquiry, this page will contain posts on trivial stuff related to subjects I find interesting.

These are the things usually explained in classrooms using classical teaching techniques like ['Proof by Intimidation (argumentum verbosium)'](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/MIT6_042JF10_proof.pdf) & get brushed under the gradesheets of students who couldn't care less about the subject.

Also included are some workarounds which other idiots like me might find useful.
