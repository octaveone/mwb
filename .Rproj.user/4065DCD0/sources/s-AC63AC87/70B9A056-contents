# ***What's This Blog About?***

<font size=4>

I started this blog out of boredom concomitant with online classes & webinars. I really hoped that studying in Hyderabad would allow me to rediscover my inner carnivore. Instead, I'm stuck indoors & mostly find myself staring at my laptop screen when I'm awake. 

And, of the many extraordinary qualities I possess, asking stupid questions is the one which
I'm really proud of. Such a quality is deemed valuable in a _slave to an excessively inquiring mind_, or so I am told.

So, you'll find posts on -

- What I have been reading - I usually read non-fiction & occasionally fiction

- Some tidbits related to my academic interests

- And finally a few ramblings, here & there
