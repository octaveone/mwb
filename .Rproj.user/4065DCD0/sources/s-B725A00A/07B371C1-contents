***How to learn from Coursera MOOCS offered in a language you don't understand?*** 

Well, with a little bit of extra effort (but of course!). But this extra effort need not be too complicated -

1. ***Enroll*** in the course (Duh!)
1. ***Download the lecture videos & the subtitles*** to your laptop/PC (really important that you do this)
1. ***Translate the subtitles*** (which are usually the files with the '.vtt' extension) using any website which offers to translate subtitles which typically involves uploading the subtitle files which you have & then downloading the translated subtitle files - I prefer [Subtitle Translator](https://subtitlestranslator.com/) which is free to use
1. ***Watch lecture videos with the subtitles on*** - If you can binge watch Neflix series in different languages, then you certainly can learn from Coursera MOOCs in different languages too!

Luckily, the courses I enrolled for were ***mathematical*** in which most the slides contained equations & diagrams - meaning less words - which mostly don't need to be translated

***Courses that prompted me to use this workaround - ***

- [An?lisis de Sistemas de Transporte ***(Transportation System Analysis)***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analisis-sistemas-de-transporte) - which is taught by, amongst others, Prof. Juan de Dios Ortuzar - whose textbook ["Modelling Transport"](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Modelling+Transport%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470760390) has led to far too many over-caffeinated study sessions than I care to admit

If you are really are interested in the subject & looking for a more approachable resource, then the co-author of the book [Luis Willumsen](http://www.luiswillumsen.com/) has written a book on traffic forecasting (geared towards practitioners) - [Better Traffic & Revenue Forecasting](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Traffic-Revenue-Forecasting-Willumsen/dp/0992843308)

- [Introducci?n a los modelos de demanda de transporte ***(Introduction to Transport Demand Models)***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/demanda-de-transporte) - which, again, is taught by, amongst others, Prof. Juan de Dios Ortuzar

- [Ingenier?a de Tr?fico ***(Traffic Engineering)***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ingenieria-trafico)

- [?C?mo viajamos por la ciudad? Asignaci?n y equilibrio en redes de transporte ***(How do we travel around the city? Allocation and balance in transport networks)***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/equilibrio-redes-transporte)
