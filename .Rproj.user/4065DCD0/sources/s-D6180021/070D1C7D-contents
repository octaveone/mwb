## The Solution

Well, with a little bit of extra effort (but of course!). But this extra effort need not be too complicated -

1. ***Enroll*** in the course

1. ***Download the lecture videos & the subtitles*** to your laptop/PC (really important that you do this)

1. ***Translate the subtitles*** (which usually end with '.vtt') using any website which offers to translate subtitles - I prefer [Subtitle Translator](https://subtitlestranslator.com/) which is free to use^[This involves uploading the subtitle files which you have & then downloading the translated subtitle files]

1. ***Watch lecture videos with the subtitles on*** - If you can binge watch Netflix series in different languages, then you certainly can learn from Coursera MOOCs in different languages too!

Luckily, the courses I enrolled for were ***mathematical***. Most of the slides contained equations & diagrams - meaning, less words. So, understanding the content in the slides wasn't really an issue.

## FYI

### The Original Problem

Coursera offers many courses which are not taught in English.

The ones I ended taking up are taught in ***Spanish*** only.

My initial solution was to translate the transcripts. This was stupid, given that it isn't easy to follow the lecture video & the translated transcript simultaneously. 

This new problem prompted me to use this workaround of translating the subtitles file, instead.

### The Courses

I've mentioned their names only in English for brevity's sake - 

- [***Transportation System Analysis***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analisis-sistemas-de-transporte) - which is taught by, amongst others, Prof. Juan de Dios Ortuzar

- [***Introduction to Transport Demand Models***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/demanda-de-transporte) - which, again, is taught by, amongst others, Prof. Juan de Dios Ortuzar

- [***Traffic Engineering***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ingenieria-trafico)

- [***How do we travel around the city? Allocation and balance in transport networks*** ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/equilibrio-redes-transporte)

If you are really interested in the subject then [Luis Willumsen](http://www.luiswillumsen.com/)'s new book on traffic forecasting - [Better Traffic & Revenue Forecasting](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Traffic-Revenue-Forecasting-Willumsen/dp/0992843308) - is a good place to start. It is a more approachable resource than [Modelling Transport](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Modelling+Transport%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470760390) by Juan de Dios Ortuzar & Luis willumsen.
