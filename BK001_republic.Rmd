#  **Why?** 

**Quick Question :** Why are NCERT textbooks on history do boring?

Well, because they aren't written by the likes of Gyanesh Kudaisya !

I found the book in the footnotes of a episode of my favorite podcast : [The Seen & The Unseen by Amit Varma](seenunseen.in)

This book seemed like a good place to start for someone itching to read about the contemporary history of India.

#  **What?** 

The book has 5 chapters spanning over 176 pages - just enough to fill up a lazy afternoon. 

**Chapter 1 | The Unfinished Business of Partition** 

The chapter begins with a brief account of the first Independence Day celebrations in Independent India. And then later goes on to deal with the violence & the huge influx of refugees (Punjab & Bengal) concomitant with Partition. 
  
The box on the *The 'Other' Partition* was particularly interesting. For those of us who weren't born then, our understanding of Partition is shaped by documentaries and films (like [Tamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamas_(film))). And we often tend to forget that India was divided not just on its western forntier, but also on its eastern one too.
    
The chapter ends with how Partition ended up affecting our polity.

**Chapter 2 | From Patchwork to Tapestry: Cartographic Reconstructions**

**Chapter 3 | Democracy: An Uncertain Journey**

**Chapter 4 | Crafting Citizenship**

**Chapter 5 | Planning Endeavours**
