In the spirit of disorganized inquiry, I like to read books on topics which pique my interest.

- I begin with a question in mind & try my best to - 

  - consider various arguments & perspectives

  - enrich my understanding of the world

  - expand my knowledge

  - form an (informed) opinion of my own

- I do not try to *fully* answer my question, because  - 

  - no single book has all the answers 

  - that would mean the end of a beautiful adventure that each question is in & of itself
  
  - reading books is a habit which is much like a Ponzi scheme - 
    
    - You read a book
    
    - You don't understand parts of it or some of the arguments made by the author (because you're probably an idiot)
    
    - You read more books to buttress your understanding
    
    - So on & so forth

- Each post is roughly organized as follows - 

  - Why did I read the book?

  - What is the book about?

  - Key takeaways

  - Interest tidbits

  - Was it worth my time? (Am I better off than the person I was before I read the book?)
  
- These posts aren't - 

  - *Reviews -* 
  
    - I'm a utilitarian. Review 'Reviews' serve no purpose in my opinion. 
    
    - Every book is a labour of love & should be treated as such.
    
    - I usually lose my appetite for reading a book after I've read it's - more often than not, highly opinionated - 'review'.
  
  - *Summaries -* 
  
    - Most non-fiction books published today can be summarized in a single A4 sheet. Self-help books are the worst offenders.
    
    - I do take notes while reading a book, but I won't be sharing them. I believe book summaries rob authors of their already meager royalties.
    
    - I usually lose my appetite for reading a book after I've read it's - more often than not, super-cringey - 'summary'.

***I love bullet points (in case you didn't notice!). Internet real estate is free !!!***
