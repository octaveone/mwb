Reading books in my vice. Especially, non-fiction (And, No, self-help & corporate bullshit doesn't count as non-fiction).

Stupid questions are usually the starting point for my adventures.

Each post is roughly organized as follows - 

- Why did I read the book?

- What is the book about? 

- Key takeaways

- Interest tidbits

- Was it worth my time?
