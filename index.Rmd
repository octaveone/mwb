# <font color="ED820E"> **What's This Blog About?** </font>

<font size=4>

I started this blog out of boredom - online classes & webinars are the culprits here. 

I really hoped that studying in Hyderabad would allow me to rediscover my inner carnivore. 

Instead, I'm stuck indoors & mostly find myself staring at my laptop screen when I'm awake.

And, of the many extraordinary qualities I possess, asking stupid questions is the one which
I'm really proud of :)

So, on this small nook of the world wide web, you'll find posts on -

- What I have been reading - I usually read non-fiction & occasionally fiction

- Some tidbits related to my academic interests & a few lazy hacks
