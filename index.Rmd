# ***What's This Blog About?***

<font size=4>

I started this blog out of boredom concomitant with online classes & webinars. 

I really hoped that studying in Hyderabad would allow me to rediscover my inner carnivore. 

Instead, I'm stuck indoors & mostly find myself staring at my laptop screen when I'm awake.

And, of the many extraordinary qualities I possess, asking stupid questions is the one which
I'm really proud of :)

Such a quality is deemed valuable in a __"slave to an excessively inquiring mind"__, or so I am told.

So, on this small nook of the world wide web, you'll find posts on -

- What I have been reading - I usually read non-fiction & occasionally fiction

- Some tidbits related to my academic interests
